# TFWP-Positive-LMIA-Analysis
Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP): Positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) Analysis project

Project Overview
This project analyzes the positive results of Labour Market Impact Assessments (LMIAs) completed by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) for the 3rd Quarter of 2023. The analysis focuses on identifying employment trends and the demand for foreign workers in Canada, specifically within Atlantic Canada.

Background
Employers in Canada can apply for permission to hire foreign workers. ESDC then assesses whether these hires will have a positive or neutral impact on the Canadian labour market. This dataset analysis aims to uncover the most requested occupations and the distribution of these requests across different sectors and Atlantic provinces.

Objectives
- To isolate data related to Atlantic Canada and analyze employment trends within this region.
- To clean the dataset by discarding records with missing occupation information.
- To identify the top 10 most requested occupations by employers and calculate the sum of approved positions for other occupations.
- To categorize occupations based on the National Occupation Classification (NOC) codes and visualize the distribution of occupation categories applied for under the TFWP.

Tools and Technologies Used
- Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas: For data cleaning and preparation.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations including pie charts and bar charts.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis process and results.

Data
The data for this project was sourced from the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP): Positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) Employers List on the Open Government Portal (canada.ca). It includes details such as the province/territory of the position, employer details, occupation, and the number of approved LMIAs and positions.
